## Overview

Optivem Docs provides a practical guide to help you accelerate your enterprise software development teams with the Optivem Framework.

## Background

Are you a leader in an enterprise software development organization, interested in producing quality software? Have you experienced the challenges in managing software projects - satisfying customers' needs to produce software faster, but yet at the same time, facing quality issues?

Have you seen systems which rapidly deteriorated in quality, whereby the architecture is a "big ball of mud", and low code quality - and the decreased productivity of the whole team? Is there an increasing pile of bugs, and are changes taking longer and longer to implement, breaking existing functionality? Do you face challenges in incorporating new team members, increasing the technical level of your team, and incorporating code standards and quality control?

Are you looking for a solution which will enable you to:

* Implement high quality enterprise software in your software teams
* Increase the productivity across your team, from junior to senior level
* Support extensible and maintainable architecture to reduce total development cost

If you've answered "yes", then you've come to the right place. We're here to support you in quality Enterprise Application Software \(EAS\) development.
