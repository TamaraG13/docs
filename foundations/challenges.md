# Challenges

## Leadership Challenges

As an IT leader, you have probably encountered the following challenges:

* How can we grow high performance software development teams?
* How can we reduce the number of bugs in our software?
* How can we speed up the development of new features?
* How can we systematically achieve success?
* How can we make our customers really happy?

## Architecture Challenges

One of the key challenges in software development is the overall productivity of the development team and consequently - the total cost of ownership, i.e. cost of development and cost of maintenance. One of the key factors which affect the total cost of software development is the software architecture.

Quoting Uncle Bob \(Clean Architecture\), “The goal of software architecture is to minimize the human resources required to build and maintain the required system” and that the ultimate goal is “to minimize the lifetime cost of the system and to maximize programmer productivity”. Architectural decisions are the “big” decisions which affect the structure of the software solution and which later become apparent when we analyze developer productivity, particularly during software maintenance.

Atomiv was envisioned to help you design and implement high quality architectures for software projects and products. Atomiv provides a templated solution architecture based on well-known best practices in clean architecture.

As a software architect, your faced with challenges in design software architectures with the following characteristics:

* Modularity & re-usability
* Extensibility & flexibility
* Maintainability & testibility
* Scalability and portability

## Development Challenges

As a software developer, you have likely faced the following challenges:

* How to meet project deadlines?
* How to write clean maintainable code?
* How to adopt TDD principles?
* How to minimize number of bugs?

## Testing Challenges

As a Test Automation Engineer, you are faced with challenges in effectively designing, implementing and maintaining automated tests:

* REST API tests
* Web Browser tests
