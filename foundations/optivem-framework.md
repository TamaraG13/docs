# Optivem Framework

### Optivem Framework

Welcome to the Optivem Framework! The Optivem Framework was created to help you increase code quality, help you deliver products faster to customers and reduce your overall software development cost. This documentation page will show you how to get up-and-running with the Optivem Framework in your .NET Core 2.2 software projects.

The Optivem Framework is designed to support the Clean Architecture, enabling:

* Modularity & re-usability
* Extensibility & flexibility
* Maintainability & testibility
* Scalability and portability

The Optivem Framework is on GitHub and NuGet:

* [Optivem Framework \(.NET Core 2.2\) GitHub](https://opensource.optivem.com/framework-dotnetcore)
* [Optivem Framework \(.NET Core 2.2\) NuGet](https://www.nuget.org/profiles/optivem)

To show the Optivem Framework usage, we developed a sample application using the well-known Northwind database from Microsoft, as an illustration relevant for enterprise software samples:

* [Optivem Northwind \(.NET Core 2.2\)](https://opensource.optivem.com/northwind-dotnetcore)
* [Optivem Northwind \(Angular 7\)](https://opensource.optivem.com/northwind-angular)

Optivem Framework and Optivem Northwind are licensed under the MIT licence, so that it can be used freely for commercial projects. Our goal is to help spread best practices in IT organizations and support developers in their daily work.







Optivem Framework was created to accelerate the development of enterprise applications, so that you can quickly create new projects for your customers.

The Optivem Framework is founded upon Clean Architecture principles and supports:

* Modularity & re-usability
* Extensibility & flexibility
* Maintainability & testibility
* Scalability and portability

The architecture consists of the following layers:

* Core Layer \(contains Domain and Application\)
* Infrastructure Layer \(contains third-party libraries and frameworks, integration with external systems\)
* Dependency Injection Layer \(used to setup the compostion root\)
* Web Layer \(contains the REST API and presentation\)
* Test Layer \(contains Unit, Integration and System tests\)
