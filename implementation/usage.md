## How can Atomiv support our senior developers?

Senior developers often have a key role in the design and architecture of software solutions - whether it's for products, projects, or modules. Aside from that, they are also involved in mentoring and supporting junior developers during development as well as code reviews. From technical perspectives, senior developers are key stakeholders in decisions regarding architecture and quality, building code re-usable, collaboration and knowledge sharing.

At some point in time, as teams and companies grow, they reach a point at which senior developers are not just involved in individual projects, but also in systematizing and standardizing development across the team - which involves often companies producing internal shared code, internal package manager setup, internal samples and templates, etc. based on best practices and coaching team members to push forward adoption. However, this can a time-consuming process, taking months or years to create the adequate code base, yet alone to implement it in practice.

Atomiv can support senior developers so that next time when they need to setup a new project, that they can get it up and running very fast. It also serves to support them in promoting standardization within the teams.

## How can Atomiv support our  junior developers?

Junior developers are an important part of software teams. When junior developers are provided with a solid foundation in software practices and clean code examples, they will be able to contribute with high productivity to software development. This is also an important asset for companies - to be able to grow talent in-house, which can be less expensive and less time-consuming than hiring externally. Over time, these juniors become more experienced and they can mentor and support the next generation of developers.

However, junior developers, a _blank slate_, can be a double-edged sword. On one hand, if junior developers are provided with the right foundation, working on a project which follows best practices, then those juniors can learn by example, and further contribute to the project success. On the other, if junior developers are provided with a poor foundation, working on a project with low quality code, then since this is all they've seen, the poor code will exponentially multiply as the team grows, further decreasing quality and productivity.

This is where Atomiv can help - by providing a template for the entire project architecture and with end-to-end sample working code, developed with best practices in mind, it provides junior developers with practical quality examples so that they can follow the template and apply it for new features and functionalities.
