# History

The historical foundations of Atomiv Architecture Standards are based on the following architectures from globally recognized experts in software architecture:

* [Hexagonal Architecture, aka. Ports and Adapters \(Alistair Cockburn, 2005\)](https://dzone.com/articles/hexagonal-architecture-is-powerful) 
* [Onion Architecture \(Jeffrey Palermo, 2008\)](https://jeffreypalermo.com/2008/07/the-onion-architecture-part-1/)
* [Clean Architecture \(Robert C. Martin, 2012\)](https://blog.cleancoder.com/uncle-bob/2012/08/13/the-clean-architecture.html)

Furthermore, it is rooted in the following design and development approaches:

* Domain Driven Design \(DDD\) \(Eric Evans\)
* Use Case Driven Design \(UCDD\)
* Test Driven Development \(TDD\) \(Kent Beck\)
* Acceptance Test Driven Development \(ATDD\)
* Behavior Driven Development \(BDD\)
