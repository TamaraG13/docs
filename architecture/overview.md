# Overview

## Challenges

One of the key challenges in software development is the overall productivity of the development team and consequently - the total cost of ownership, i.e. cost of development and cost of maintenance. One of the key factors which affect the total cost of software development is the software architecture.

Quoting Uncle Bob \(Clean Architecture\), “The goal of software architecture is to minimize the human resources required to build and maintain the required system” and that the ultimate goal is “to minimize the lifetime cost of the system and to maximize programmer productivity”. Architectural decisions are the “big” decisions which affect the structure of the software solution and which later become apparent when we analyze developer productivity, particularly during software maintenance.

Atomiv was envisioned to help you design and implement high quality architectures for software projects and products. Atomiv provides a templated solution architecture based on well-known best practices in clean architecture.

As a software architect, your faced with challenges in design software architectures with the following characteristics:

* Modularity & re-usability
* Extensibility & flexibility
* Maintainability & testibility
* Scalability and portability

## Objectives

The objectives of Atomiv Architecture Standards are are to develop software architecture systems which satisfy the following characteristics:

* Modularity & re-usability
* Extensibility & flexibility
* Maintainability & testibility
* Scalability and portability

This enables software teams to achieve the following:

* Decrease overall development and maintenance costs
* Enable high level of testability and high quality level
* Provide a standardized foundation for software development teams
