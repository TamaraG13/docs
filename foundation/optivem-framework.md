# Optivem Framework

### Optivem Framework

The Optivem Framework is designed to support the Clean Architecture, enabling:

* Modularity & re-usability
* Extensibility & flexibility
* Maintainability & testibility
* Scalability and portability

The Optivem Framework is on GitHub and NuGet:

* [Optivem Framework \(.NET Core 2.2\) GitHub](https://opensource.optivem.com/framework-dotnetcore)
* [Optivem Framework \(.NET Core 2.2\) NuGet](https://www.nuget.org/profiles/optivem)

To show the Optivem Framework usage, we developed a sample application using the well-known Northwind database from Microsoft, as an illustration relevant for enterprise software samples:

* [Optivem Northwind \(.NET Core 2.2\)](https://opensource.optivem.com/northwind-dotnetcore)
* [Optivem Northwind \(Angular 7\)](https://opensource.optivem.com/northwind-angular)

Optivem Framework and Optivem Northwind are licensed under the MIT licence, so that it can be used freely for commercial projects. Our goal is to help spread best practices in IT organizations and support developers in their daily work.
