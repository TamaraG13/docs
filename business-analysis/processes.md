# Processes

## Business Overview

We are making a software application for a B2B eCommerce business called Eastwind Traders \(based on the classic Northwind Traders example\). Eastwind Traders is a company which sells products to Customers. It is both B2B \(has Business Customers\) and B2C \(has Private Customers\). It gets the products from its Suppliers. 

## Customer Process

Business Customers are companies. Their employees need to make customer orders, where they can choose which products they want to buy, specify the quantities, and then make payments. Private Customers also need to make customer orders. After the order is submitted and payment is made, then the order is shipped to the customer.

## Supplier Processes

Suppliers are Companies. Their employees can manage the product catalog. They have scanners so that when orders are shipped, inventory is updated.
