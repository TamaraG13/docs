# Overview

In this section, we provide a template for business analysis, based on analysing business processes and requirements for a sample eCommerce application.

Firstly, we provide a template for documenting business processes:

{% page-ref page="processes.md" %}

Then based on the business processes, actual use cases can be extracted to identify the users of the system and what they can perform:

{% page-ref page="use-cases.md" %}

Finally, we provide a template for documenting domain entities and events:

{% page-ref page="domain.md" %}
