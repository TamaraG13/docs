# Demo

Throughout this documentation, we will be using a "practical" example, whereby the template will be made using a eCommerce example - online store builder. It's called eStoreBuilder. eStoreBuilder enables businesses to create business accounts, and then they can add products which they sell. When customers go the to the webshop for that business, they can sign up as customers, add products to the card, and make an order as well as payments for the order.
