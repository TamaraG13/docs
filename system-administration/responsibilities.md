# Responsibilities

## **Monitoring and alerting**

Depending on your toolchain and technology stack, the system administrator is in charge of monitoring and alerting across your applications and infrastructure. Monitoring core server and network metrics like CPU, disk usage, DNS, latency and ETL can help SysAdmins detect an incident. Then, they can set up alerts based on monitoring thresholds to receive on-call notifications in case of any major incidents.

## **User permissions and administration**

System administrators are generally in charge of user permissions and administration for all applications and services. SysAdmins can assign user roles and manage the entire organization’s IT stack – allowing everyone the access they need to certain applications and services in a secure way.

## **SSO and password management**

The SysAdmin is tasked with managing passwords and [Single sign-on \(SSO\)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_sign-on) policies and practices across the company. They are able to reset passwords and ensure security requirements are met everywhere. If using SSO and/or two-factor authentication, the system administrator is in charge of managing these tools and helping employees get access to the systems they need when they need it.

## **File organization and management**

To ensure data organization and consistency, the SysAdmin will usually place policies and procedures around the way files are organized and shared within the organization. Along with most of the other SysAdmin responsibilities, this is to ensure security from external attacks as well as ensuring appropriate, easy access to files for employees.

## **System usage policies and procedures**

At a very general level, the system administrator will need to define best practices for working within the organization’s systems. This includes everything from proprietary software you’re building to different third-party IT applications and services. By showing employees how to use systems in a secure, productive way, SysAdmins are able to completely change the way work is conducted within an organization.

## **Software installation, updates and upkeep**

It’s the SysAdmin’s job to put policies and procedures in place to keep up with software installation and updates. If there are any errors with new updates or interdependencies between new versions of systems, the SysAdmin should be able to detect these issues and fix them.

## **Redundancies, rollovers and recovery plans**

SysAdmins should have active, updated plans for redundancies, rollovers and incident recovery. Through effective monitoring, alerting and cross-functional communication, the system administrator should be able to quickly detect any failures and remediate IT incidents.

## **Security**

Security should be top-of-mind across everything a system administrator works on. Whether it’s user permissions or the way the team maintains documentation, the SysAdmins needs to perform all actions in a secure way. As they set up networks, policies and servers, the SysAdmin will know how to do it in a technically sound, secure way.
